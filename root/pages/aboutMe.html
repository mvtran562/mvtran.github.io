                🏫 I am a multifaceted individual driven by passion, and I am a full-time student at Santa Clara University pursuing a B.S. degree in Computer Science and Engineering. I am actively looking for any software engineer intern positions for 2024. I love technology, motorsports, and creating.

                👨‍🔧 I have a year of professional experience working in electrical, embedded, and manufacturing engineering with Booster USA and CTD USA, working with and assisting engineers as a technician at Apple, Tesla, Aehr Test Systems, etc. by building and developing prototype projects with them. An example was an AirPods® testing unit used to simulate and compare radio interference of radio waves to test Bluetooth® capability, and my role was to put together the final assembly and test the Linux system.

                👨‍💻 I have several years of software projects through both academic lab projects and personal projects. These include data structure & search implementations (arrays, binary trees/heaps, linked lists, hash tables/maps, etc), application projects (Live food truck assistance app, Greek-life dating app, e-commerce stock monitor, etc), and socket programming (Computer Networks). These were implemented with C,C++, Python, Java, Dart/Flutter, Javascript, and HTML/CSS.
            </p>
            <p>
                🏛️ My academic experience includes relevant coursework like Advanced Data Structures, Electrical Circuits, Embedded Systems, Logic Design, Computer Networks, and Cryptography

            <p>
                🏙️ Apart from engineering, my professional experience extends to professional automotive video/photo content production (JC Culture Foundation, Freelance), optometric technician (Dr. Pham Optometry), social media & marketing (SCU Campus Ministry, SCU Ski and Board, Subiewerks), DJ/event service (Freelance), and retail (HomeGoods, Wheel Away Cycle Center). I also enjoy refining my mechanical skills by modifying cars and enjoying the outdoors with tennis, mountain biking, and snow sports as Vice President & Founder of SCU Ski and Snowboard Club
